It is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into childhood.\" (from \"Paracosmic Immersion,\" Cyborg Anthropology & Wikipedia).<br/><br/>This VR experience is an attempt at materializing a world that came from childhood dreams and memories. Experienced sitting down, with no hand controllers, \"Paracosm I\" attempts to evoke feelings of detachment and calm in the viewer as they spend a few moments in a place of solitude.

I worked with Processing and the Minim library for working with sound files. I learned how to work with the Minim API to use an FFT to analyze a sound file. The 'stars' are clustered into three concentric bands, and I chose three corresponding audio frequency ranges to visualize the low, middle, and high frequencies. Stars are randomly assigned to be a plain or pulsating star (indicated in blue). <br/><br/><sub><sup>*</sup><i>This video plays audio.</i></sub>",

I went into the field and spoke with professional caretakers to understand their students’ primary needs, and involved them throughout the research and design processes to ensure that these needs were being fulfilled.<br/><br/>These conversations and observations, along with an extensive literature review, informed the design of an iOS app called ‘VidCoach,’ an app built upon video modeling, an effective tool for reaching and retaining skills.

The culmination of this qualitative research was a critical design workshop with the members of one of the makerspaces we visited.<br/><br/>Drawing upon Dunne and Raby's seminal work on critical and speculative design, participants collaborated in exercises around imagining what an ideal future would look like, and investigating how their spaces could be designed towards obtaining that ideal future.",
