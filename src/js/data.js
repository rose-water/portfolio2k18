It is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into childhood.\" (from \"Paracosmic Immersion,\" Cyborg Anthropology & Wikipedia).",

Perennial is a little world, a gentle vessel, a patient portal.<br/><br/>This project was built with Cinema 4D, Three.js, and Web Audio. Perennial was exhibited as an interactive installation (using Leap Motion) at the 2018.1 Showcase at Gray Area Foundation for the Arts.",

I went into the field and spoke with professional caretakers to understand their students’ primary needs, and involved them throughout the research and design processes to ensure that these needs were being fulfilled.<br/><br/>I also spoke with management at several companies in the surrounding area to ask for volunteers who would be willing to conduct mock interviews with the students and evaluate their performances.<br/><br/>These conversations and observations informed the design of an iOS app called ‘VidCoach,’ an app designed to aid students in learning and retaining valuable life skills. The first release of the app was aimed at teaching students how to interview for jobs.",

My fieldwork involved interviewing members of several makerspace communities on the west coast to develop an understanding of the need for these spaces to exist, and to understand how certain tools and frameworks that are ingrained/integrated into these spaces enables them to support women, POC, and traditionally marginalized groups in high tech culture. The culmination of this qualitative research was a design workshop with the members of one of the makerspaces we visited.<br/><br/>Drawing upon Dunne and Raby's seminal work on critical and speculative design, participants collaborated in exercises around imagining what an ideal future would look like, and investigating how several systemic and infrastructural portions of the past and present would need to be refigured to bring about that ideal future.",
