Although these processes have undoubtedly led to work that we’re proud of, we also realized that they can feel quite formulaic and potentially limiting for our creative outputs. \“What are some ways that we can gain new insights and perspectives in our own work?\” <br/><br/>To answer this question, I decided to start a digital zine as a platform for supporting a community of peers working across creative disciplines in expanding our artistic, design, and research practices.<br/><br/>Each issue of PROPAGATOR is put together based on a loosely structured prompt that invites contributors to engage in an activity meant to be outside the norms of their creative practices and professional work.<br/><br/>In ISSUE 01, \"DREAM MACHINE,\" contributors were asked to attempt dream journaling for several weeks, to talk about their experiences with dream journaling, and to create a piece based on their entries. The format of their dream journals was not predetermined, rather, they were asked to experiment with different methods to get a feeling for what was right for them. This zine issue features contributors' works (where submissions included 3D art for the web, data visualizations, short essays, video essays, and illustrations) alongside images of their dream journals.",

I worked with Processing and the Minim library for working with sound files. I learned how to work with the Minim API to use an FFT to analyze a sound file. The 'stars' are clustered into three concentric bands, and I chose three corresponding audio frequency ranges to visualize the low, middle, and high frequencies.

I went into the field and spoke with professional caretakers to understand their students’ primary needs, and involved them throughout the research and design processes to ensure that these needs were being fulfilled.<br/><br/>These conversations and observations, along with an extensive literature review, informed the design of an iOS app called ‘VidCoach,’ an app built upon video modeling, an effective tool for reaching and retaining skills.

The culmination of this qualitative research was a critical design workshop with the members of one of the makerspaces we visited.<br/><br/>Drawing upon Dunne and Raby's seminal work on critical and speculative design, participants collaborated in exercises around imagining what an ideal future would look like, and investigating how their spaces could be designed towards obtaining that ideal future.",

One of the apps was a custom timer that could communicate to the installation ushers when it was time to let another visitor into the experience. This was an important component given the sequential nature of the experience; only one memory was shown in the installation at a time. An usher would talk to a visitor for a maximum of five minutes about the visitors' chosen memory and uploaded photo. They needed to be able to communicate when they were done with each visitor to the specialists working behind the scenes, so that they could begin mixing audio and crafting custom smells. The second app was a website where visitors could upload their photos to a server, which was built to support the high foot traffic of visitors at SXSW.",

        "content" :"Although virtual reality is becoming more widely adopted, the creation and curation of virtual reality content is closed to a vast majority of users; the software tools are not only owned by corporations, they often present steep learning curves for consumers. <br/><br/>As a Design Technologist at Junior, I worked on a project which aimed to lower these barriers around VR content creation. Working on an interdisciplinary team of engineers and designers, I helped design and build a CMS mobile web app that enables users to upload and share their 360° photospheres.<br/><br/>These uploaded photospheres could then be annotated with text, sound, website hyperlinks, and teleportation links to other 360° experiences that they uploaded. These annotations were represented with visual cues that could be explored within the space.<br/><br/>My roles in this project were to lead the visual design and contribute to the UX research for PocktVR. While this project was built to cater to consumers, we also did early research around contextualizing use within commercial applications, specifically for small, independently–owned businesses with storefronts. For example, we imagined and prototyped a scenario in which a shop might take a 360° photosphere of portions of their store. A shopowner might try to tell their stories through the various media annotations offered, as well as use them as ways to describe and sell their products. In addition to visual design and UX research, I also contributed to the front-end development for the platform.",
